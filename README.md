Using k-Nearest Neighbors to Predict Marketing Campaign Success

For this assignment, we will utilize the bank marketing dataset from UCI. This dataset comprises 17 attributes related to marketing campaigns (phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, which is indicated by the variable 'y'. Please download and extract the dataset from the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing. The specific dataset you will be working with is stored in bank-full.csv.
